        <h3>First, Thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwlEry_ER4">Martin Orth</a>
</h3>

<p>Mr. Orth created the original version of this app, <a href="http://www.cfsolutions.de/qb/">which you can see demo of here</a>. His version is generally excellent, but incomplete. The purpose of this project is to carry the original to fruition. </p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The app doesn't yet have a build process or any scaffolding, but if you simply pull the repo and add it to your local web server--you should be able to run it without any snags. Since the app uses ExtJs, which in turn depends upon an async resource loader, you'll run into problems trying to run it directly from the file system. You can also run the latest version at the <a href="https://c9.io/somecallmechief/oj-sqlbuilder/workspace/index.html">C9 instance</a>.</p>

<h3>TODO: Priority 1</h3>

<p>The app is currently using static, hard-coded values for the tree of database tables and the associated tables of database columns. The first priority is to abstract the functionality of loading data into a direct object assignment on construction or a deferred assignment as the result of an ajax request. Both are mandatory. </p>

<h3>TODO: Priority 2</h3>

<p>It is not currently possible to edit JOINs at all. This will have to change.</p>

<h3>TODO: Priority 3</h3>

<p>Order by and aggregate functionality needs to be completed.</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<p>Normally, I publish everything I write to the Public Domain; however, this is not entirely my work to give away. <a href="http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?208444-Ext.ux.window.VisualSQLQueryBuilder">Mr. Orth has granted permission for ambitious folks to do what they will with the source</a>. The project itself comes out of Germany with no stated copyright or license. The code may very well be Public Domain already, but I will happily defer to the wishes of Mr. Orth until I have rewritten the entire application in my own programmatic idioms. Further, since the entire application is dependent upon ExtJs; the license would likely need to be consistent with the latest ExtJs license--whatever that might be. With all that said, I think Fair Use adequately covers the app. So use it Fairly.</p>
